          This is a proof of concept for labelling events in a screen recording
          of someone coding using machine learning. This video is an extract
          from a teaching video, so it's a bit more friendly than a typical
          screen recording. However, note that all of the labels were extracted
          using OCR â€” no manual labelling was done. Click play to start. You can
          also click the labels on the right to skip to that moment. Feel free
          to unmute the video too.
